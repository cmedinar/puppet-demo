# Session 4 - Exercises
## Exercise 1
Build an nginx module that:
* Is able to install nginx package in Centos and Ubuntu
* Ensures that the document root is present
* Ensures that the index.html is personalized with your hostname and ip address
* Declare your nginx class in a smoke test and run it
Use the following considerations:
* Document root has to be /var/www
* The service is not yet enabled, so we won't be able to browse in the web page.
